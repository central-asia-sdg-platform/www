However, food production systems put serious stress on ecosystems and natural resources (Targets 12.2, 14, 15).\nWhile generally water stress in Kazakhstan is lower than in some neighbouring Central Asia countries, much of the country‚Äôs water resources go to agriculture (63%). Climate change will put a serious stress on food production systems through changing water flows. It will require adaptation to new conditions (Targets 13.2, 13.3).\nRegional cooperation (Targets 17.10, 17.11) could be a key to increased value added of agricultural products and reduced pressure on natural resources, and to ensure women‚Äôs full participation in agricultural practices and climate action (Target 5.5).\n\nüî∑ 4.4: Skills for employment. In the age of rapid economic and social changes, ensuring relevant skills (Target 4.4) for youth is a crucial accelerator for the whole SDG agenda, as it can accelerate economic growth and make it more resilient. Kazakhstan had a high 15.8 expected years of schooling in 2021. However, the quality of education and equal access remain concerns. In the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, students in Kazakhstan scored lower than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average in reading (387 vs 487), maths (423 vs 489) and science (397 vs 489). An analysis shows the significant isolation of disadvantaged students from high performing students\nAddressing evident differences (Target 10.1) in education (see PISA 2018) the PISA study notes that expanding options for boys and girls will contribute to women‚Äôs empowerment (Target 5.5). Sustainable urbanization, including transportation services (Targets 11.1, 11.2), and targeted inclusion policies for disadvantaged groups (Targets 1.3, 10.3) will contribute to improving equality of opportunities\nBuilding future-proof skills improving employability and reducing skills mismatch are essential for achieving sustainable economic growth (Goal 8) and reducing poverty (Goal 1). This will promote equal access to the labour market for women/girls and men and the further empowerment of women to participate into the local labour market (Target 5.5) , including by enhancing their access to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics and ICT education (Targets 5.5, 5.b).\n\nüî∑ 7.2. Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the energy mix. Access to affordable and sustainable energy is crucial for Kazakhstan‚Äôs development. The renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption hovered under 2% in the past decade. Coal represents some 50% of the total energy supply, followed by natural gas (some 30%) and oil (close to 20%). Energy prices do not take into account long-term marginal costs and environmental externalities. Energy efficiency (Target 7.3) deteriorated from 8.6 MJ/GDP* in 2010 to 5.38 in 2015 and remained at that level since then. An energy transition is required for the sustainable future of Kazakhstan‚Äôs economy\nHowever, an energy transition entails short-term costs. Energy price rises have a negative impact on the most vulnerable segments of the population (Target 10) and must be accompanied by policies to mitigate this impact (Targets 10, 1.3) for Kazakhstan\nRenewable and clean energy plays a crucial role in achieving health and gender equality outcomes (Targets 3, esp. 3.9; 5, esp. 5.1., 5.2., 5.4., 5.5, 5.a). Sustainable energy sources contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Goal 13), promoting renewable energy, and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy (Goal 12)\nIndustrialization (Goal 9) will put further demand on ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, and there will be possible trade-offs between the availability of energy and the use of renewables (Target 7.2).\n\nüî∑ 10.4: Adopt policies for greater equality. SDG 10.4 calls for the adoption of policies to progressively achieve greater equality in Kazakhstan. The size of Kazakhstan and the variety of its socio-economic and environmntal conditions are driving forces of inequalities, amplified by the varying availability of infrastructure (Goal 9)\nAchieving SDG 10.4 has synergetic links with various other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), as reducing inequality contributes to poverty eradication, improves health outcomes and advances sustainable economic development. SDG 10.4 is also intrinsically linked with greater gender equality (Targets 5, esp. 5.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.b) and women‚Äôs empowerment\nHowever, pursuing greater equality may require trade-offs in terms of fiscal adjustments and resource allocations (SDG 17).\n\nThe dynamic map shows SDG Accelerators for Kazakhstan.\n\n\n\nUse buttons to highlight certain paths and Focus to explore certain targets\n\nSee üìä SDG Push Diagnostic for Kazakhstan\nRead the üìë Integrated SDG Insights Report for Kazakhstan\n\nVoluntary National Reviews\n\nüåê Voluntary National Review 2022\n\nüåê Voluntary National Review 2019\n\n\n","id":""},"/www/central-asia-kgz/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/central-asia-kgz/","title":"Central Asia - Kyrgyzstan\n","content":"\n\nKyrgyzstan, a small landlocked country in Central Asia, has made progress in achieving the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since adopting the agenda in 2015. Kyrgyzstan has taken significant steps to reduce poverty and inequality, promote good health and wellbeing, and provide quality education. In 2020, Kyrgyzstan presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which outlined the country‚Äôs progress in implementing the SDGs and identified key challenges that need to be addressed.\n\nProgress in SDGs\n\n\nBased on Global SDG Indicators and Diagnostics üü© On Track ¬†¬†¬† üü® Mixed / For Review ¬†¬†¬† üü• Off Track ¬†¬†¬† ‚¨õ Trends NA\n\nSDG Accelerators\n\nüî∑ 2.2. Ensure food security. Target 2.2, focusing on food security and (mal)nutrition, holds significant importance for Kyrgyzstan. None of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs SDG 2 targets are on track; most are off track. Despite significant progress in reducing prevalence of stunting in children (from 18% in 2010 to 11% in 2020), the prevalence of anaemia among women remains high (around 35%), reflecting the persistent prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity (Target 2.1). Access to safe and nutritious food improves health outcomes (Target 3) and benefits educational achievements (Goal 4).\nWhile irrigation is key for achieving food security, water is also central to Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs energy balance, which relies heavily on hydro power. Due to drought conditions a threeyear energy sector emergency has been declared. Ensuring food security links closely to SDG 8, creating employment and contributing to rural economic growth. Equal access to resources (Target 1.4), especially the guarantee of women‚Äôs rights to access and control resources (Target 5.a) could contribute to accelerating progress. Target 2.1 aligns with SDG 12‚Äôs emphasis on sustainable consumption and production, promoting sustainable food systems and waste reduction.\nBy building resilient agricultural practices (Target 2.4), Kyrgyzstan can free up more water for hydropower (Goal 7), mitigate the impacts of climate change and support climate action (Goal 13), while maintaining viability of ecosystems, especially in mountainous regions (Goal 15). Ultimately, ensuring food security fosters social stability, reduces conflicts arising from food scarcity and promotes effective food governance (Goal 16).\n\nüî∑ 4.3. Quality education for everyone . In Kyrgyzstan, SDG target 4.3 aims to ensure equal access to quality technical, vocational and tertiary education. Kyrgyzstan has a high 13.2 expected years of schooling in 2021 and a high upper secondary education completion rate of around 96% over the past decade.\nHowever, quality of education and equal access remain concerns. SDG 4.3 has important interlinkages with other SDGs, especially Goal 8, through improving employability, reducing the skills mismatch, ensuring the future readiness of people in the workforce and ultimately reducing poverty (Goal 1).\nThis will promote equal access to the labour market for women/girls and men and further the empowerment of women to participate in the local labour market, including by enhancing their access to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and ICT education (Targets 5.5, 5.b). Quality technical education will equip individuals with skills aligned with labour market demands, fostering decent work and economic growth (Goal 8). Ultimately, equal access to technical education will reduce inequalities, empowering individuals, groups and localities left behind, and promoting social inclusion (Goal 10).\n\nüî∑ 7.1, 7.2, 7.3. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Access to affordable and sustainable energy is crucial for Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs development and it is an accelerator for the whole SDG agenda. Despite universal access to electricity (Target 7.1) and high share of renewables (the renewable energy share remains relatively stable close to 30% in past decade), especially hydropower in electricity generation (Targets 7.2, 7.3), vulnerabilities and issues remain evident.\nCurrently the country suffers from an electricity generation deficit and a presidential decree declared a three-year emergency in the energy sector. Hydropower, a renewable energy, is a mixed blessing. It requires water, which may raise issues (Target 6.5) with downstream countries. Availability of water is increasingly affected by climate change, making the supply of hydroelectricity unpredictable. Affordable and reliable energy drives economic growth, job creation and entrepreneurship opportunities (Goal 8) and sustainable industrialization (Goals 9, 10, 11). Thus, it reduces income poverty (Goal 1), including energy poverty (Target 1.4), and improves well-being.\nIt is vital for health care facilities (Target 3) and access to education (Goal 4). Sustainable energy sources contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Goal 13), by promoting renewable energy and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy (Goal 12). At the same time, industrialization (Goal 9) will put a further demand on ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, and on the need for possible trade-offs between energy availability and the use of renewables.\n\nüî∑ 8.6. Youth employment and education. According to UN Stats, none of Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs SDG8 targets are on track. In the Kyrgyzstan context SDG Target 8.6 aligns with the goal of reducing poverty (Targets 1.1, 1.2) through promoting decent work, providing individuals with opportunities for sustainable income generation and economic empowerment.\nEnsuring equal access to quality technical, vocational and tertiary education (Target 4.3) and providing relevant skills (Target 4.4) is one of the key drivers of this target. Kyrgyzstan has a high 13.2 expected years of schooling in 2021 and high upper secondary education completion rate (which was around 96% over the past decade).\nHowever, quality of education and equal access remain concerns. Promoting equal access to the labour market for women/girls and men and the further empowerment of women to participate in the local labour market, including by enhancing their access to STEM and ICT education (Targets 5.5, 5.b).\nEconomic policies (Target 8.3), facilitation of business development and trade (Targets 8.a, 17.10, 17.11) and building economic institutions (Target 16.6) will accelerate progress.\n\nüî∑ 11.1. Safe and affordable housing and basic services. In Kyrgyzstan quality of life‚Äîin terms of affordable housing and basic services‚Äîvaries significantly by regions. According to UN Stat data, only half of the rural population (57%) is using safely managed drinking water services, compared to virtually universal access in urban areas (91%). According to national data, 35% of the population have sustainable access to sanitation facilities, ranging from 98% in Bishkek city to less than 1% in the Osh region.\nDespite universal access to electricity (Target 7.1) and a high share of renewable hydropower in electricity generation (Target 7.2), vulnerabilities and issues remain evident. Non-sustainable urbanization and lack of affordable fuels result in high air pollution in urban areas, affecting the health of the population (Target 3.9).\nProviding universal access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services requires investments in resilient infrastructure (Target 9.1, 9.4) to prepare them for climate change and disasters (Targets 1.5, 13.2). Recognition and redistribution of unpaid care work, through social protection policies and the development of adequate care infrastructures and services (Target 5.4). It will contribute to the reduction of inequalities (Goal 10) and to reducing conflicts (Goal 16). It also could have a positive impact on the sustainability of ecosystems (Goals 6, 14, 15).\n\nThe dynamic map shows SDG Accelerators for Kyrgyzstan.\n\n\n\nUse buttons to highlight certain paths and Focus to explore certain targets\n\nSee üìä SDG Push Diagnostic for Kyrgyz Republic\nRead the üìë Integrated SDG Insights Report for Kyrgyz Republic\n\nVoluntary National Reviews\n\nüåê Voluntary National Review 2025 (forthcoming)\n\nüåê Voluntary National Review 2020\n\n\n","id":""},"/www/central-asia-tjk/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/central-asia-tjk/","title":"Central Asia - Tajikistan\n","content":"\n\nTajikistan, a mountainous country in Central Asia, has made significant strides towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since adopting the agenda in 2015.

Ensure food security. Target 2.2, focusing on food security and (mal)nutrition, holds significant importance for Tajikistan. It addresses eradication of worst form of poverty (Goal 1) by ensuring access to nutritious food. Despite significant progress in reducing prevalence of children stunting (by half from 30% in 2010 to 15% in 2020). However, further efforts will be focused on prevalence of children wasting and anaemia among women deteriorate, reflecting persistent malnutrition.\nAccess to safe and nutritious food improves health outcomes and benefits educational achievements (SDGs 3 and 4). Moreover, it links closely to SDG 8, creating employment and contributing to rural economic growth.

Quality education for everyone. In Tajikistan, SDG target 4.3 aims to ensure equal access to quality technical, vocational, and tertiary education. Tajikistan shows reasonable 11.7 expected years of schooling in 2021 and good progress in upper secondary education completion rate (which increased from 61 to 76 over past decade). Further efforts will be focused on ensuring quality of education, equal access and early child development.\nSDG 4.3 and related 4.4 have important interlinkages with other SDGs, especially Goal 8 trough improving employability, reduce skills mismatch, and ensuring future-readiness of the people in the workforce, and ultimately reduced poverty (Goal 1). This will promote equal access to labour market for women/girls and men and further empowerment of women to participate into the local labour market (Target 5.5).\nQuality technical education will equip individuals with skills aligned with labour market demands, fostering decent work and economic growth (Goal 8). Quality technical education and future-proof skills are important driving factors of industrialization (Target 9.2) and sustainable urbanization (Target 11.1). Ultimately, equal access to technical education will reduce inequalities and promotes social inclusion (Goal 10).\n\nüî∑ 9.2. Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization. SDG 9.2 aims to foster inclusive and sustainable industrialization in Tajikistan for enhancing its economic growth (Goal 8) and job opportunities, especially for young people (Target 8.6). Despite recent improvements, manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP and per capita remains relatively low in Tajikistan (around 12% in 2016-2019). Economic policies (Target 8.3) play important role in industrialization, as well as reliable access to energy (Target 7.1) and infrastructure (Target 9.1).\nAnother accelerator for industrialization is adequate skill formation (Targets 4.3, 4.4), and ensuring future-proof skills. It is closely linked to investment in women and girls across all levels of decision-making in political and economic life (5.5) and enhancement of use of technology to empower women (5.b).\nHowever, the pursuit of industrialization also entails trade-offs. It requires careful consideration of environmental sustainability, as industrial activities can have adverse ecological impacts‚Äîaffecting ecosystems (Goals 15, 2), potable water (Goal 6), health of people (Goal 3). Rapid industrialization could put pressure on energy access (Target 7.2) at the expense of energy sustainability (Targets 7.2, 7.3). Ensuring inclusivity in this process is crucial to prevent potential social, gender, and territorial inequalities (Goals 10, 5)\n\nüî∑ 11.1. Safe and affordable housing and basic services. In Tajikistan quality of life‚Äîin terms of affordable housing and basic services‚Äîvaries significantly by regions. On average only 55% of population using safely managed drinking water services, and 74% have hand-washing facility. Further efforts should ensure universal access to electricity (Target 7.1) and high share of renewable hydropower in electricity generation (Target 7.2), taking into account non-sustainable urbanization and lack of affordable fuels result in high air pollution in urban areas, affecting health of population (Target 3.9).\nNon-sustainable urbanization and lack of affordable fuels result in high air pollution in urban areas, affecting health of population (Target 3.9).\nProviding universal access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services requires investments in resilient infrastructure (Targets 9.1, 9.4) to make them climate change and disaster ready (Targets 1.5, 13.2).

The agricultural productivity and rural development. Target 2.3, focusing on food security and agricultural productivity, holds significant importance for Turkmenistan for ensuring food security of the country. Despite significant progress in reducing prevalence of children stunting (from 11.5% in 2016 to 7.1% in 2019 according to MICS-5 and MICS-6), prevalence of anaemia among women remain high (around 27%, according to WHO/GHO estimates), reflecting the need to further address the issues of food security (Target 2.2).\nAccess to safe and nutritious food improves health outcomes and benefits educational achievements. Moreover, it links closely to SDG 8, creating employment and contributing to rural economic growth. Target 2.3 aligns with SDG 12‚Äôs emphasis on sustainable consumption and production, promoting sustainable food systems and waste reduction. By building resilient agricultural practices (Target 2.4), including guarantee of women‚Äôs rights to access and control resources (Targets 1.4, 5.a), Turkmenistan can mitigate climate change impacts and support climate action (Goal 13), while maintaining viability of ecosystems, especially water ones (Goals 6, 14, 15).\nUltimately, ensuring food security fosters social stability, reduces conflicts arising from food scarcity, and promotes effective food governance.\nüî∑ 3.4. Reduce mortality from noncommunicable diseases. Non-communicable diseases are play important role in health in 8 out of 10 main causes of death in Turkmenistan, top three are Ischemic heart disease, Stroke, and Cirrhosis (according to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019). Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease (probability) in Turkmenistan showed fair progress, but acceleration is required to reach target level 19%.\nPremature mortality from non-communicable diseases is affected by metabolic factors (high blood pressure, high body mass index), behavioral risks (malnutrition, dietary risks, SDG 2.2), as well as environmental risks (SDGs 14, 15).\nAccess to quality infrastructure, especially water and sanitation (Targets 6.1, 6.2, 11.1), improving economic outcomes (Targets 8.1, 8.5, 8.6) and inclusion (Targets 10.1, 5.5, 1.5) play important role in reducing these risks. Well functioning health institutions (SDGs 3, 16) play crucial role in prevention of mortality.\nExcessive mortality takes a heavy toll on economic growth (Goal 8) by reducing labor force and exacerbating inequalities, which requires social protection policies (Goals 5, 10)\nüî∑ 4.4. Skills for employment. In Turkmenistan, SDG target 4.4 aims to ensure technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship through equal access to quality technical, vocational, and tertiary education. Turkmenistan shows high 13.2 expected years of schooling in 2021. Quality of education and equal access remain priorities. SDG 4.4 has important interlinkages with other SDGs, especially Goal 8 trough improving employability, reduced skills mismatch, and ensuring future-readiness of the people in the workforce, and ultimately increase social wellbeing.\nThis will promote equal access to labour market for women/girls and men/boys‚Äîgender differences remain evident in particular on female-to-male education and seats held by women in national parliament. This will further empowerment of women to participate into the local labour market including by enhancing their access to STEM and ICT education (Targets 5.5, 5.b). Quality technical education will equip individuals with skills aligned with labour market demands, fostering decent work and economic growth (Goal 8).\nUltimately, equal access to technical education will reduce inequalities and promote social inclusion (Goal 10).\nüî∑ 6.1. Universal and equitable access to safe drinking water. In Turkmenistan almost everyone (99.9% in 2019 according to MICS-6) is using safely managed drinking water services. Access to safe and affordable drinking water is closely linked with achievement of health targets (Goal 3), both related to communicable diseases and noncommunicable diseases. Sustainable water management closely linked with sustainable urbanization (Targets 1.4, 11), sustainable agriculture (Goal 2), industrialization (Goals 8, 9, 12), and gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment (Goal 5, esp. 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.a).\nHowever, there are evident trade-offs between SDG targets. Water in Turkmenistan is actively used in agriculture, leading to high levels of water stress (withdrawals absorbed 87% of available freshwater resources in 2021, according to VNR2023). Climate change (Goal 13) makes access to safe and affordable drinking water for all a challenging task. Industrialization and especially oil and gas exploration (Goals 8, 9) increases the risks from toxic waste.\nüî∑ 8.5. Full and productive employment and decent work. In Turkmenistan context the SDG Target 8.5 aligns with the goal of increasing population wellbeing. By promoting decent work, Turkmenistan can contribute to improvement of life quality by providing individuals with opportunities for sustainable income generation and economic empowerment. By ensuring adequate skill formation (Targets 4.4, 4.3), promoting employment opportunities (Target 8.3) with fair wages, job security (Targets 8.8), and social protection (Goal 10), and addressing low rates of women‚Äôs employment, including through STEM and ICT education (Targets 5.5, 5.b), Turkmenistan can create a more productive workforce.\nJob creation is closely linked with sustainable industrialization (Target 9.2). Despite recent improvements, manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP capita declining in Turkmenistan (from peak 52.3% in 2012 to 32.5% in 2022, according to UNSTAT data from UNIDO).\nHowever, the pursuit of economic growth and industrialization also entails trade-offs. It requires careful consideration of environmental sustainability, as industrial activities can have adverse ecological impacts‚Äîaffecting ecosystems (Goals 15, 2), potable water (Goal 6), health of people (Goals 3). Rapid industrialization could put pressure on energy access (Targets 7.2) at the expense of energy sustainability (Targets 7.2, 7.3).

Quality education for everyone. Investments in human capital is a crucial accelerator for the whole SDG agenda for Uzbekistan. Ensuring equal access for all to quality education produces relevant skills (Target 4.4) for youth, which is key in the age of rapid economic and social change, as well as being a driver of sustainable industrialization and digitalization. Investments in secondary education (Target 4.1) and competitive skills (Target 4.3) could help young people to set out on a future-proof path, ensuring employment (Target 8.6), and contribute to accelerated economic growth (Target 8.1).\nAddressing evident differences (Target 10.1) in education by expanding options for boys and girls will contribute to women‚Äôs empowerment (Target 5.5). Investment in women and girls across all levels of decision-making in political and economic life (Target 5.5) and enhancement in the use of technology to empower women (Target 5.b) contribute to achieving this target. Sustainable urbanization, including transportation services (Targets 11.1, 11.2) and targeted inclusion policies for disadvantaged group (Targets 1.3, 10.3) will contribute to improving equality of opportunities.\n\nüî∑ 8.3. Policies for economic development. The policies for accelerated, inclusive and sustainable growth of Uzbekistan‚Äôs economy (Target 8.3) aim at improving the well-being of the population. These policies seek to achieve faster economic growth (Target 8.1) through sustainable industrialization (Target 9.1), digitalization (Target 9.c) and trade facilitation (Targets 8.a, 17.10, 17.11).\nThe growth has the potential to increase agricultural productivity (Target 2.3) and industrial productivity (Targets 9.2, 9.3) ‚Äì both development priorities for Uzbekistan. Digitalization, which lies at the heart of these policies, requires developing quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including ICT (Targets 9.1, 9.c)\nEconomic growth policies should resolve trade-offs with the quality of economic growth, namely achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (Target 12.2) and of resource efficiency (Target 8.4), increasing energy efficiency (Targets 7.2, 7.3) and, ultimately, decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation while ensuring climate resilience (Targets 13, 14, 15).\n\nüî∑ 11.1. Safe and affordable housing and basic services. In Uzbekistan the quality of life ‚Äì in terms of affordable housing and basic services ‚Äì varies significantly by regions. On average only 59% of the population is using safely managed drinking water services, while in urban areas this rate is much higher at 86%, compared to only 31% in rural areas.\nNon-sustainable urbanization and lack of affordable fuels result in high air pollution in urban areas, affecting the health of the population (Target 3.9). Providing universal access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services requires investments in resilient infrastructure (Targets 9.1, 9.4) to make them climate change and disaster ready (Targets 1.5, 13.2). Investment in women and girls across all levels of decision-making in political and economic life (Target 5.5) and guarantee of their rights to access and control resources (Targets 1.4, 5.a) will also contribute to improving the well-being and resilience of livelihoods.\nIt will contribute to reducing inequalities (Goal 10) and also to reducing conflicts (Goal 16). Measures to decrease multidimensional poverty (Target 1.2) and to tackle inequalities (Goals 10) are deeply rooted in improving well-being and in building the resilience of livelihoods. It also could have a positive impact on the sustainability of ecosystems (Goals 6, 14, 15)\n\nüî∑ 12.2. The sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources (Green Economy). The policies for accelerated growth would not be relevant, if they were not delivering inclusive and sustainable growth. Target 12.2, focusing on sustainable use of natural resources, lies at the heart of the Green Economy. It is closely linked with sustainable and inclusive agricultural practices (Targets 2.3, 2.4, 2.5), energy transition (Targets 7.2, 7.3), sustainable infrastructure (Targets 9.1, 9.4) and an inclusive economy (Targets 1.4, 2.3, 4.4, 5.5, 10.3).\nBuilding a just and inclusive economy requires investment in women and girls across all levels of decision-making in political and economic life (Target 5.5) and guarantee of their rights to access and control of resources (Targets 1.4, 5.a). The goal of the green economy is decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation while ensuring climate resilience (Targets 13, 14, 15).\nBuilding the green economy ‚Äì one of the strategic goals of Uzbekistan ‚Äì requires resolving short-term trade-offs with the pressing needs of accelerated growth. It requires providing transitory social protection measures to those affected by the transition (Target 1.3), building skills for the future (Target 4.4) and investments in sustainable infrastructure (Targets 9.1, 9.4) using innovative finances (Target 17.3).\n\nThe dynamic map shows SDG Accelerators for Uzbekistan.\n\n\n\nUse buttons to highlight certain paths and Focus to explore certain targets\n\nSee üìä SDG Push Diagnostic for Uzbekistan\n\nRead the üìë Integrated SDG Insights Report for Uzbekistan\n\nVoluntary National Reviews\n\nüåê Voluntary National Review 2023\n\nüåê Voluntary National Review 2020\n\n\n","id":""},"/www/central-asia/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/central-asia/","title":"Central Asia\n","content":"Central Asia, a region encompassing Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, is a culturally rich and diverse region that has undergone significant social and economic development in recent years.

Without adequate financing, it is impossible to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The private sector and innovative financing mechanisms can play a critical role in mobilizing resources and scaling up financing for SDGs.\n\nUNDP SDG Finance Service Offers\nIntegrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs)\nA policy and institutional tool for mobilising and managing public and private finance to support SDG-aligned national plans and to manage risk in the face of future shocks.\nSDG Budgeting\nEmbedding the SDGs within the allocation and expenditure processes of the national budget to enable scarce public finance to be favourably aligned with the SDGs and national development priorities.\nSDG-Aligned Fiscal and Debt Instruments\nFinance for the SDGs can be enhanced through the issuance of debt instruments that align with debt sustainability objectives and leverage finance directly for sustainable development outcomes.\nLeveraging International Public Finance for the SDGs\nInternational public finance and south-south cooperation have an important role to play in supporting reforms. They must catalyse wider resources and means of implementation to advance the SDGs.\nUnlocking Private Finance for the SDGs\nEnabling private sector capital to flow to SDG related investment at scale will require policy and regulatory shifts, better access to information on investment opportunities, and clear standards on the criteria for identification of SDG aligned investment.\nAligning Business Strategies and Operations for the SDGs\nAdjusting business models to integrate a calculation of sustainable development returns into their balance sheets will help align private sector growth to the SDGs.\nImpact Measurement and SDG Finance Reporting\nStrengthening the coherence of government systems to classify and track public finance and the frameworks used by the private sector to report on their development impact is central to generating the data needed for decision makers to mobilize and align finance with the SDGs. \nThe dashboard  gives a picture of planned, ongoing and completed activities within SDG Financing in the RBEC countries and territories. It is structured along the seven action areas.\n\n\n\nDFA and INFF\nThe Development Finance Assessment (DFA) is an analytical tool that can help identify financing gaps and opportunities in Central Asia, and the Integrated National Financial Framework (INFF) provides a strategic approach to aligning financial systems with SDGs.\n\n Kazakhstan\nKazakhstan is strongly committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is setting itself up to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. With the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the government embarked on a development finance assessment (DFA) to analyse existing financial resources and identify opportunities to mobilise additional sources of finance more efficiently to achieve the SDGs.\n\nA DFA supports governments and their partners in identifying and building consensus around solutions to address financing challenges. It makes finance issues accessible to policy and decision makers. It follows a process of a multi-stakeholder consultation informed by accessible analysis on finance policy issues and what they mean for a wide range of actors and builds an agreed road map that can support progress across a range of areas.\n\nThis report addresses both the first and second dimensions of a DFA. These analyse the development finance landscape of both public and private available resources and the integration and alignment between the planning and financing processes in Kazakhstan.\n\nThis exercise serves the purpose of warming up the government and its development partners to the idea of undertaking a complete DFA or consider developing an integrated national financing framework (INFF). Therefore, this report suggests an initial set of recommendations that constitute initial steps toward implementing the INFF building blocks and strengthen Kazakhstan‚Äôs SDG financing mechanism.\n\nThe report is structured according to the DFA dimensions. The first chapter explores Kazakhstan‚Äôs financing landscape. It focuses primarily on the past decade, starting from 2008 in line with the availability of official data. Chapter two describes the current state planning system and how it aligns with the budgetary processes. It compares the formal, de jure institutional set-up, according to government legislation, with the de facto planning and budgetary practices, based on available, recent expert analysis and consultations with government stakeholders. The third and final chapter suggests priority areas for improvement, based on the previous analysis.\n\n\n\nKazakhstan Development Finance Assessment 2021\n\n Kyrgyzstan\nThe Development Finance Assessment (DFA) presents a review of the Kyrgyz Republic‚Äôs financial landscape covering domestic and international public and private flows, as well as policy, institutional, capacity and risk management dimension, and links to the Program for Medium-Term Development (2021-2026). The DFA (which is Building Block 1 of the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) presents the overall development financing context (Chapter 1), the sustainable development context (Chapter 2), a detailed review of the Kyrgyz development finance landscape (Chapter 3), a review of integrated planning and budgeting withing which Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be aligned (Chapter 4), and financing strategy entry points (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 provides an overview of new financing instruments to be considered by the three key target sectors identified by the President‚Äôs Administration and is support by a review of Governance and Coordination (Chapter 7) and Monitoring and Review (Chapter 8) recommendations, while Chapter 9 provides a Roadmap of Actions to be executed over the short, medium and longer term.\n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic as an Aspiring Leader in SDG Financing \nThis DFA has been driven by the President‚Äôs Administration, signifying the intent to deepen and green both financial and capital markets, and to make sustainability a key driver of national development aligned to the national vision and Medium-Term Program. In line with the approach to mainstream the SDGs into governance and coordination and monitoring and review processes, the aim is to fully align and integrated the SDGs into government policy, and to deploy the new SDG financing approach as a new way of thinking, leading to a shift in mindset from a traditional approach to financing, to one that is much more focused on mobilizing private capital and incentivizing innovation. Given interests in increasing both domestic and foreign flows (including foreign direct investment, portfolio inflows and better using diaspora funds), strengthening accountability, transparency and anti-corruption efforts will remain central to progress.\n\nSustainable Financing Gaps That Need to be Addressed\nUnless domestic public and private and international public and private resources are successfully mobilized to finance the SDGs, there is a great risk that despite efforts to integrate SDGs into public policy and spending, many of the SDGs may not be achieved due to under-investment. On the back of the COVID-19 crisis and ongoing war in Ukraine, the need to address gaps and overcome blind spots has become increasingly apparent. In conducting a thorough review of the financing landscape ‚Äì including detailed dialogue with public officials, private sector and international community partners, the following overall approach has been established, to address gaps and seize opportunities.\n\nKyrgystan Development Finance Assessment  2023\n\n Tajikistan\nTajikistan‚Äôs INFF focuses on systemic change, with a clear commitment to leaving no one behind.\nThe INFF in Tajikistan is anchored in the country‚Äôs National Development Strategy for 2016-2030. Its aim is to promote evidence-based policies and actions backed by disaggregated data by gender and other vulnerability metrics; to build technical and managerial capacities and strengthen partnerships with key government institutions; and to improve the accountability and transparency of the government‚Äôs budgeting practices in order to achieve the national SDG targets.\n\nThe INFF will contribute to key long-term goals, including poverty reduction, gender equality and non-discrimination, as well as quality education and early childhood development. As an integrated resource mobilisation strategy is embedded in government systems, additional financial resources including off-budget sources of financing, will be leveraged to support achievement of these goals, and national SDG targets more broadly.\n\n Turkmenistan\nTurkmenistan‚Äôs INFF focuses on strengthening public financial management and enhancing private sector financing for sustainable development. \nTurkmenistan conducted a Development Finance Assessment (DFA) under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The findings of this assessment will inform the development of the integrated national financing strategy that will help strengthen public financial management and increase private sector financing towards achieving sustainable development priorities.\n\n Uzbekistan\nThe UNDP Development Finance Assessment (DFA) is a tool to identify opportunities to mobilize additional finance sources and use existing financial resources more efficiently to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Misalignment between the planning and finance policy functions of government, a narrow focus on public resources to finance the SDGs, and the participation of only a narrow group of stakeholders in the SDG financing dialogue and decision-making process are key challenges in many countries, including Uzbekistan. Through a process of informed dialogue, a DFA offers support for governments and their partners in identifying and building consensus around priority solutions to address these important financing challenges.\n\nUzbekistan‚Äôs first DFA assesses the country‚Äôs SDG financing architecture. It addresses critical knowledge gaps around the volume and trends of available  development finance in the country considering current SDG progress and the impact of the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. It provides the context analysis for the UN SDG Fund‚Äôs two-year Joint Programme (2020-2022) to implement priority SDG financing reforms in Uzbekistan. Finally, it aims to inform progress towards adopting an Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF), in support of a cohesive, nationally owned sustainable development strategies, as per the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The Government of Uzbekistan is strongly commitment to achieving the SDGs. In 2018, the 16 national SDGs and their 125 corresponding targets were adopted. Simultaneously, an inter-agency Coordination Council for implementing the national SDG Roadmap was established, along with the creation of a bicameral Parliamentary Commission on SDGs. The implementation of the SDGs in Uzbekistan coincided with large-scale reforms in the framework of the national Action Strategy for 2017-2021, which provides the pathway to achieving the SDGs. In 2020, Uzbekistan presented its first Voluntary National Review on SDG progress.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis risks slowing down Uzbekistan‚Äôs impressive SDG progress. The country‚Äôs substantial informal sector is leaving a large amount of people vulnerable to the slowdown, driving up poverty and inequality. These socio-economic vulnerabilities are further compounded by environmental threats. In response to the pandemic, the GoU adopted an Anti-Crisis Program with a USD1 billion fund to support businesses and employment, and to expand social assistance to the most vulnerable.\n\nAlready prior to COVID-19, Uzbekistan‚Äôs available SDG financing was increasing too slowly to meet the country‚Äôs financing needs. Estimates from 2019 revealed Uzbekistan needs at least an additional, annual investment of USD 6 billion to meet the nationalized SDGs. Now, in 2020, the IMF estimates addressing the external shock and the domestic impact of COVID-19 will require an additional external financing of about USD 4 billion, or 7 percent of GDP.\n\n\n\nUzbekistan Development Finance Assessment 2021\n\nInnovative financing\nWorld experience suggest a wide range of innovative financing tools that can be relevant for Central Asia:\n\n  Blended Finance - a combination of public and private capital to support sustainable development projects.

The report shows that across countries and regions, women and girls face tremendous structural barriers that impact all aspects of their lives. For this reason, it is of paramount importance for governments to ‚Äúdouble down‚Äù on their efforts, including by radically overhauling international financial rules. The report‚Äôs authors argue that $500 billion need to be mobilized per year by 2025 to fund policy integration, and that it is of paramount importance for countries to increase their commitment to multilateral integration, and sustainable development.\n\nGlobal commitments\nThe 2023 Report of the Secretary-General (Special Edition) on the progress towards SDG highlights that if we do not change the way things are going it will take 286 years to close gender gaps in legal protection and remove discriminatory laws, 140 years for women to be represented equally in positions of power and leadership in the workplace, and 47 years to achieve equal representation in national parliaments. It consequently calls on the governments to advance concrete and targeted policies and actions to reduce inequality, with a particular focus on advancing the rights of women and girls and empowering the most vulnerable.\n\nActions are needed to accelerate progress, including through the promotion of laws, policies, budgets and institutions that advance gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment. Those are enshrined in the global commitments, including in SDG5. Goal 5 has nine (9) targets and fourteen (14) indicators, focusing in particular on: combating harmful social norms and patriarchal stereotypes perpetuating gender disparities; eliminating violence against women and girls; addressing early and forced marriage; advancing women‚Äôs participation in the economy and society; ensuring equal opportunities for leadership; and securing universal access to sexual and reproductive rights. While SDG5 focuses on promoting gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment, a twin-track approach, a globally recognized strategy built on gender-targeted interventions and gender-integrated efforts, where gender dimensions and perspectives are mainstreamed into all the 17 SDGs through 54 gender-specific indicators is a must.\n\nAccelerating SDGs\nThe achievement of positive and long-lasting change in gender equality has proven to generate positive effects on economic growth and labour productivity (SDG8), health (SDG3) and education (SDG4), multiplying the efforts for poverty reduction (SDG1). Gender equality is also critical for attaining food security (SDG2) and addressing climate change (SDG13), while adopting a gender responsive approach contributes to strengthening resilience to climate-related disasters and ensuring a more sustainable management of natural resources. Finally, providing equal opportunities for women‚Äôs participation in decision-making processes is beneficial for ensuring more peaceful and inclusive communities (SDG 16). \nMoreover, to realize the potential of SDG5 as an accelerator for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, a transformative approach based on the use of factual evidence and data needs to be adopted. Currently, only 47 percent of data required to track progress on SDG5 is available. Sex-, gender- and age-disaggregated data allows to identify target audience and to better address their needs, while an intersectional approach to data allows the development of tailored analyses and interventions. Indeed, gender intersects with other factors in defining different conditions under different circumstances, which need to be taken into account when developing policies and strategies. Applying a gender lens is also a way to question power relations, and reveal the root causes of inequalities that put at risk the overall progress. For these reasons, all priority areas (from climate change to digital transformation, and so forth) must ensure the equal participation of women and girls, from different backgrounds and experiencing different needs and barriers, in decision-making processes, and their full access to and control over assets and resources.\n\nMeasures for consideration\nThe socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately hit women and girls and further amplified gender inequalities. Disproportionate unemployment and livelihood losses, education setbacks, increased burdens of unpaid care work, and rising gender-based violence rates are only some of the challenges that women and girls have experienced with more acuity since the start of the pandemic. Women were also disproportionately exposed to COVID-19, accounting for up to 70 percent of the healthcare workforce worldwide, and were more prone to completely exit the labour force (this is true particularly for mothers). For women and girls who experience various and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence based on their ethnicity, age, income, location, disability status, or other factors, the negative effects were exacerbated. Despite this, only a third of policy measures adopted by governments worldwide and in the Europe and Central Asia region to tackle the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic integrated a gender lens.\n\nTackling the underlying causes of gender inequalities which substantially contribute to the stalling progress on the achievement of the Agenda 2030, requires concrete actions on different fronts, starting from the adoption of gender responsive laws, policies, institutions, programming, and budgets across different areas. Currently, in the Europe and Central Asia region, significant challenges remain in the achievement of SDG5, while progress is only moderately increasing. This is in line with global trends: worldwide, 380 million women and girls still live under the poverty line (SDG1), one in three women and girls experience moderate or severe food insecurity (SDG2), 102 million women and girls of reproductive age live in areas where abortion is prohibited (SDG3), more than 800,000 women and girls die every year because of the lack of clean water (SDG6), and 49 percent of women living in urban areas report not feeling safe when walking alone at night (SDG11). Understanding that without advancing gender equality and empowering women and girls, the achievement of all 17 SDGs is in peril, is key to developing effective strategies to accelerate overall progress, address current blind spots and prevent backsliding, with the ultimate aim of leaving no one behind and achieving the 2030 Agenda more broadly.\n\nThe 2023 Report of the Secretary-General (Special Edition) on the progress towards SDG points to the need for commitments to invest in women and girls and leave no one behind, notably by:\n\n  Leveraging special measures and quotas to promote gender parity across all levels of decision-making in political and economic life;\n  Accelerating women‚Äôs economic inclusion by closing the digital divide;\n  Investing in women-owned businesses and reducing the unpaid care and domestic burden for women and girls;\n  Passing laws and putting in place emergency response plans that prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls, both on and offline;\n  Dismantling all discriminatory laws and practices.\n\n\nPartnerships for achieving the SDGs\nTo effectively achieve SDG5 and all the other Goals, it is imperative for governments to actively engage and collaborate with a broad spectrum of partners. Among these, civil society organizations (CSOs), academia, and media play pivotal roles in propelling progress. CSOs serve as catalysts for gender equality movements and contributing to transformative shifts in social norms. With their grounded presence within local communities, CSO leaders offer specialized expertise and an intimate comprehension of the nuanced needs and realities faced by women and girls across diverse experiences. Similarly, academia provides essential insights through cutting-edge research and trend analyses of the most pressing issues facing women and girls, offering guidance on gender-sensitive data collection and evidence-based recommendations. These inputs guarantee that policies are comprehensive, inclusive, and relevant for all. By collaborating with media outlets, governments can provide a platform for dialogues with the public on gender-related concerns, initiate awareness campaigns underscoring the significance of gender equality, and harness the narrative power to spotlight successful case studies of policies that advance gender equality. Such collaborations can be instrumental in developing guidelines and ethical benchmarks for gender-sensitive communications across both traditional and digital media platforms. Through consistent engagement with a diverse set of stakeholders, governments can enact policies that dismantle systemic barriers that continue to hold women and girls back, enabling them to unleash their fullest potential. This concerted approach empowers governments to embrace an informed, holistic, and intersectional strategy approach to achieving SDG5 and beyond, facilitating coordinated and innovative solutions that ensure women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs well-being, safety, and equitable access to education and employment opportunities.\n","id":""},"/www/guineapig/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/guineapig/","title":"Guineapig\n","content":"This is a test page for experiments\n\nEmebedding elements\nInformaton from other sites could be embedded using &lt;iframe&gt; html code.

Remote areas on the Afghan border (üü• high security risk by 2030)\nCentral Asia‚Äôs southern remote areas, notably the Tajik-Afghan and the Turkmen-Afghan border areas have been identified as climate change and security hotspots in light of extreme weather events intensified by climate change and their exposure to spill-over of instability.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Promote scientific, business and educational ties with neighbouring countries, including on environmental, energy, food security and climate change threats within the framework of multilateral and bilateral arrangements and the Economic Cooperation Organization\n  Exchange information and experience and implement pilot projects with neighbouring countries on assessment of climate change impacts and risk reduction regarding livelihoods, preservation of agricultural biodiversity and  monitoring of and responses to malaria, pests and dust storms\n  Conduct afforestation and reforestation on the southern borders of Central Asia to improve microclimates, combat erosion, protect infrastructure and reduce dust storms\n  Develop and implement warning and response mechanisms to deal with natural disasters and extreme weather events, and develop co-operation in monitoring activities\n\n\n3. High mountain areas (üü® security risk by 2030)\nMountain communities have increased vulnerability due to high poverty and isolation, frequent natural disasters, visible climate change effects and sporadic discontent and unrest in some mountainous regions.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Provide remote sensing in hard-to-reach areas\n  Diversify income and food sources\n  Diversify power generation and channels of energy imports and exports in order to reduce the risk of energy crises in extreme weather events (scarce water, cold waves and low water flow in large and small rivers devastating flash flooding and floods)\n  Incorporate climate change content into planning and maintenance of critical infrastructure (impact of melting permafrost and avalanches or landslides on communication routes, hazardous waste storage sites and mines)\n\n\n4. Central Asia breadbasket (üü© low security risk by 2030)\nThe grain-producing area in northern Kazakhstan has been identified as a regional climate change hotspot, although security implications in the national context are low thanks to stable economic policies. Soaring grain prices or crop deficits may however undermine food security in the region.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Facilitate farming practices that use zero soil tilling and test crop types resilient to extreme events\n\n\n5. The Amu Darya River Basin (üü® medium security risk by 2030)\nThe Amu Darya Basin is highly dependent on irrigation and hydropower with already existing disagreements on water usage, and is characterized by environmental degradation, in particular in the delta area. Reinforced by climate change, this might have severe impacts for water, food, livelihood and human security with strong cross-border implications.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Identify and improve water use practices for the reduction of damage to vulnerable areas from climate change\n  Engage all countries of the basin (including Afghanistan) in monitoring, forecasting, assessment and current and long-term water planning and use\n  Strengthen the role of and support the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea with regards to its activities in water management of the Amu Darya River\n\n\n6. The Syr Darya River Basin (üü® medium security risk by 2030)\nThe Syr Darya River is highly regulated for irrigation and hydropower purposes. The basin also faces risks from toxic and radioactive waste. The current water allocation regime might come under threat from changing water availability due to climate change which might increase water, food, and socioeconomic insecurity.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Strengthen capacities at local level on adaptation to climate change and security risks including through experience replication\n  Develop a common understanding of climate change impacts and search for mutually acceptable solutions to the water-food-energy nexus dilemmas\n  Continue to improve early warning bulletins for the Syr Darya River\n  Improve transboundary co-ordination mechanisms and ensure that obligations are met\n  Strengthen the role of and support to the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea with regards to its activities in water management of the Syr Darya River\n\n\n7. The Zarafshan River Basin (üü® medium security risk by 2030)\nThe Zarafshan River, shared by Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, suffers risk of upstream pollution from growing industrial activities and mining and downstream pollution from agriculture, and faces increased water insecurity due to climate change impacts which could affect interstate relations.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Facilitate development of a common understanding of climate change impacts and search for shared approaches\n  Develop a system for forecasting seasonal and longterm flows\n  Enhance sharing of information related to climate change and natural disasters\n  Increase water use efficiency in combination with traditional methods\n\n\n8. The Ili River and Balkhash Lake (üü® medium security risk by 2030)\nLake Balkhash in southeastern Kazakhstan is the largest lake in Central Asia and fed mainly by the Ili River, which originates in China. The fragile ecological balance of the lake is at risk by human, economic and climate change impacts, which affect the population in the basin and pose a challenge for transboundary water management.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Incorporate climate change into planning and use of water resources and economic development\n  Support transboundary dialogue and co-operation on management of water resources and climate change adaptation\n\n\n9. The Chu and Talas River Basins (üü© low security risk by 2030)\nThe Chu and Talas River Basins, shared by Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are an important economic area for agriculture, hydropower and mining sectors with a growing population. While climate change might decrease the availability of water, the good co-operation mechanisms that are already in place between the two countries minimize the security risks.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Continue discussions on climate change impacts in the transboundary context and enhance co-operation on adaptation\n  Evaluate investment costs for eco-friendly services and adaptation measures\n\n\n10. The Caspian Sea and coastline (üü® medium security risk by 2030)\nBeing rich in oil and gas resources, the Caspian Sea is economically important and at the same time vulnerable to climate change and water level fluctuations. Climate change might affect economic and livelihood security, and the unclear marine borders might make joint responses more difficult.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Extend practices of climate risks assessments for vulnerable infrastructure and onshore and offshore oil and gas production sites\n  Improve water supplies for local populations and minimize oil sector impacts on the environment and on income sources (fisheries, pastures and the others)\n\n\n11. The Aral Sea and coastline (üü© low to üü® medium security risk by 2030)\nThe tragedy of the Aral Sea is likely to continue due to higher temperatures and due to low run-off reaching the sea, even though the situation in the northern part has improved. Anthropogenic pressure on water resources remains the major risk factor. Climate change will intensify water and environmental insecurity of the affected population.\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n  Introduce additional, and support current, practices and ongoing efforts to cut back on environmental migration, and maintain adequate living conditions\n  Develop and implement comprehensive public awareness campaigns on climate security, adaptation measures and personal responsibility in the field of risk reduction\n\n\nCross-border SDG issues\nCentral Asia, a region encompassing Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, is a culturally rich and diverse region that has undergone significant social and economic development in recent years. Addressing cross-border issues in Central Asia is the key for achieving SDGs\n\nWater management\nCentral Asia is home to several major rivers, including the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which are shared by multiple countries. Disputes over water allocation, infrastructure development, and pollution are common. One solution is to promote regional cooperation through the establishment of joint institutions, such as the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), which is supported by the EU and UNDP. Other initiatives include the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúCAREC Integrated Water Resources Management Project‚Äù and the EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Water-Energy Nexus Dialogue Platform.‚Äù\n\nEnergy security\nCentral Asia is a major producer and exporter of oil, gas, and electricity, but many countries still face energy shortages and rely on imports. There is also a need to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Energy Security Dialogue‚Äù and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúRegional Dialogue on Energy Security in Central Asia‚Äù aim to promote cooperation on energy policy and investment.\n\nTrade development\nCentral Asia has enormous potential for trade, but many countries still face barriers to accessing international markets. Promoting trade and economic integration, as well as investing in infrastructure and human capital, can help unlock this potential. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúSupporting the Implementation of WTO TFA in Central Asia‚Äù project and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúIntegrated Framework for Trade-Related Assistance to Least Developed Countries‚Äù aim to promote trade facilitation and economic growth.\n\nBorder management\nCentral Asia has many porous borders, which pose security risks and can impede trade and travel. Promoting transparency and cooperation among border agencies, as well as investing in infrastructure and technology, can help address these challenges. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúBorder Management Programme for Central Asia‚Äù and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Border Security Programme‚Äù are working to support these efforts.\n\nEnvironmental degradation\nCentral Asia faces many environmental challenges, including desertification, deforestation, and air and water pollution. These issues often transcend national boundaries and require regional cooperation and policy coordination. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Climate Change‚Äù project and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asian Desert Initiative‚Äù are working to promote sustainable land use and environmental management.\n\n\n","id":""},"/www/kaz-sdg7/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/kaz-sdg7/","title":"SDG7 in Kazakshtan\n","content":"SDG 7 aims to Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\nIt includes three targets and two means of achievements:\n\n  Target 7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services\n  Target 7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix\n  Target 7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency\n  Target 7.a By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology\n  Target 7.b By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support\n\n\nProgress in SDG7 targets in Kazakhstan:\n\n  Target 7.1 Access to clean energy üü© On track, including üü¢ Indicator 7.1.1 üü¢ Indicator 7.1.2\n  Target 7.2 Renewable energy üü• Off track\n  Target 7.3 Energy efficiency üü• Off track\n\n\nInterlinkages\nSDG 7 is closely related with a number of SDG goals, especially 1, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13\n\n\n\nExplore connections in details:\n\n","id":""},"/www/news/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/news/","title":"News &amp; Events\n","content":"News and Events\nCheck this page for news regarding the reporting of our statistics for global indicators and opportunities to contribute to measuring achievement of the sustainable development goals\n","id":""},"/www/parliaments/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/parliaments/","title":"Parliaments and SDGs\n","content":"With only a few years left to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), mobilizing parliaments around the global development agenda is becoming increasingly urgent.

Kyrgyzstan has also developed an SDG Action Plan for 2021-2023, which focuses on improving data collection and monitoring, promoting sustainable agriculture and tourism, and strengthening partnerships with civil society and the private sector.\n\n Tajikistan\n\nTajikistan‚Äôs ‚ÄúNational Development Strategy‚Äù for 2016-2030 integrates the SDGs and focuses on improving human development, promoting economic growth, and protecting the environment. The country‚Äôs VNR in 2019 highlighted progress in areas such as access to clean water, maternal and child health, and education, while identifying challenges related to poverty, gender inequality, and energy security. Tajikistan has also developed an SDG Roadmap for 2018-2030, which includes specific targets and indicators for each SDG, and aims to mainstream the SDGs into national policies and programs.\n\n Turkmenistan\n\nTurkmenistan has developed an ‚ÄúSDG Implementation Framework‚Äù for 2016-2020, which focuses on improving social and economic development, environmental sustainability, and governance. However, the country has not yet submitted a VNR to the UN. Turkmenistan has also launched several initiatives to promote the SDGs, such as the ‚ÄúNational Plan of Action for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation‚Äù and the ‚ÄúNational Program for the Improvement of the Social and Living Conditions of Rural Population.‚Äù\n\n Uzbekistan\n\nUzbekistan‚Äôs ‚ÄúAction Strategy‚Äù for 2017-2021 integrates the SDGs and focuses on economic liberalization, social modernization, and regional cooperation. The country‚Äôs VNR in 2020 highlighted progress in areas such as poverty reduction, education, and healthcare, while acknowledging challenges related to gender equality, environmental sustainability, and governance. Uzbekistan has also launched several initiatives to promote the SDGs, such as the ‚ÄúNational Action Plan for the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals‚Äù and the ‚ÄúGreen Growth Strategy.‚Äù\n\nMAPS: Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support\nThe United Nations (UN) has supported countries in Central Asia through the deployment of cross-thematic, multiagency MAPS (Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support) missions. These missions aim to support policy-making for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying gaps, opportunities, and policy solutions in key areas. The MAPS approach includes consultations with government officials, civil society, and other stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the country‚Äôs development priorities. In Central Asia, MAPS missions have been carried out in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. They have resulted in the development of action plans that focus on areas such as education, health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. The UN system‚Äôs support through MAPS missions in Central Asia has helped to strengthen national capacities for SDG implementation and monitoring, and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs in the region.\n\n  Kazakhstan: ‚ÄúMainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support for the SDGs in Kazakhstan‚Äù (2018)\n  Kyrgyzstan: ‚ÄúKyrgyzstan: Accelerating the SDGs‚Äù (2020)\n  Tajikistan: ‚ÄúTajikistan: MAPS Mission Report‚Äù (2018)\n  Turkmenistan: ‚ÄúTurkmenistan: MAPS Mission Report‚Äù (2017)\n  Uzbekistan: ‚ÄúUzbekistan: MAPS Mission Report‚Äù (2018)\n\n","id":""},"/www/private-sector/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/private-sector/","title":"Private Sector and SDGs in Central Asia\n","content":"The private sector plays a pivotal role in driving development and advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across Central Asia, emphasizing cross-border cooperation, the role of Afghanistan, and the significance of investments.

The United Nations is responsible for coordinating the global monitoring process, which involves collecting and analyzing data from member countries, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders. The United Nations has designated specific organizations known as ‚Äúcustodian agencies‚Äù to lead the monitoring efforts for each of the 17 SDGs. These custodian agencies are responsible for developing and maintaining the indicators used to track progress towards their respective SDGs, as well as collecting and analyzing data from countries and other sources. The global monitoring process, with the support of custodian agencies, helps identify areas where progress is lagging and enables countries to learn from each other‚Äôs experiences in achieving the SDGs. By monitoring progress at a global level and involving custodian agencies, the international community can assess the effectiveness of policies for SDGs, and adjust strategies and resources accordingly to accelerate progress towards sustainable development.\n\nNational SDGs monitoring\nNational monitoring of SDGs involves tracking progress towards achieving the 17 sustainable development goals within a particular country. National monitoring requires the development of indicators, data collection mechanisms, and reporting frameworks that align with the global SDGs monitoring framework. By monitoring progress towards achieving the SDGs at the national level, countries can assess the effectiveness of their policies and strategies and identify areas where they need to improve. National monitoring of SDGs also facilitates the involvement of civil society organizations and other stakeholders in the SDGs implementation process, promoting transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement.\n\n\n  Kazakhstan: The Committee on Statistics of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Link).\n  Kyrgyzstan: The National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic (Link).\n  Tajikistan: The State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Tajikistan (Link).\n  Turkmenistan: The State Statistics Committee of Turkmenistan (Link).\n  Uzbekistan: The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics (Link).\n\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that website links and information can change over time.\n\nRegional SDGs monitoring\nRegional monitoring of SDGs involves tracking progress towards achieving the 17 sustainable development goals in a specific region or sub-national area. Regional monitoring is particularly relevant in countries with significant regional disparities in development outcomes and provides a useful mechanism for identifying these disparities and targeting policies and resources to address them. Regional monitoring also facilitates the sharing of best practices and experiences between different regions, promoting learning and cooperation among sub-national entities.

VNRs are country-led assessments of progress towards achieving the SDGs and involve the submission of a report by each country to the United Nations. The report presents the country‚Äôs achievements, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing the SDGs, as well as its plans for future action. VNRs are voluntary, but their submission is highly encouraged and viewed as a way for countries to engage in dialogue and share experiences on SDGs implementation. The VNR process enables countries to learn from each other‚Äôs experiences and challenges, identify gaps in their policies and strategies, and improve their efforts towards achieving the SDGs. Moreover, VNRs facilitate transparency and accountability, as countries are expected to report on their progress towards the SDGs to their citizens and the international community.

It summarizes COVID response policies, grouped by countries, Response type, and Policy measures. The database provides a preliminary mapping of policies and programs to quantifiable variables that can be modeled in a systems map. Based on qualitative analysis, a set of possible scenarios (or development pathways) has been developed. This set corresponds to various dimensions of sustainable development and reflects possible paths of COVID recovery‚Äî(i) Health first: addressing the immediate health crisis caused by COVID-19 as well as strengthening health systems and outcomes more broadly; (ii) Protecting people: addressing the needs of the most vulnerable in the population, providing cash and in-kind assistance; (iii) Economic response and recovery: supporting business recovery, SMEs and the development of a more robust economy; (iv) Macroeconomic response and multilateral collaboration; and (v) Social cohesion and community resilience: improving governance and social equalities.\n\nTo promote knowledge sharing and peer learning a webinar was organized on 14 December 2021. The case study of North Macedonia ‚ÄúThe European Pathway of The Republic of North Macedonia: Achieving Faster, More Inclusive and Sustainable Growth. North Macedonia 2035: Policy, Institutional and Economic Convergence With the EU‚Äù were presented by Aleksandar Stojkov, the lead author. Presentation of case study followed by very productive technical discussion. The webinar concluded with several practical takeaways:\n\n  While IFs model is not a silver bullet, it provides a very useful tool for shaping policy discussion, especially if nationalized, maintained by local institutions (think tanks, academia), and regularly updated,\n  This requires capacity building for a better understanding of how the model works, its strong sides, and its limitations. Pardee Center provides very rich model documentation and is responsive to user requests.\n  Quality of data is key. It requires continuous collaboration with Pardee and National Statistical Office to validate and update data. International data available in IFs by default provide a very good basis for discussion of assumptions, e.g. benchmark for indicators, realistic rates of progress, etc.,\n  Presenting scenarios to policymakers requires intending a balance between complexity and simplicity; and using good visualizations to pass the message. Good practices from Macedonia were shared with participants.\n\n\nAll policy decisions come with trade-offs in resources and capacity. IFs allow us to explore not just the potential results of intervention packages in Central Asia but also their trade-offs and synergies. For example, while some scenarios result in better outcomes for the economy, they may perform less well in terms of human development outcomes like health and education. Governments operate with limited resources ‚Äì investing heavily in one sector inhibits investment in others. And different policies or approaches benefit different groups. \nThe two most powerful individual scenarios for poverty reduction are the Protecting People scenario, which addresses poverty directly through welfare transfers, and the Economic Response, which reduces poverty through economic growth. But each scenario is more focused on reducing different levels of poverty. While most of the poverty reduction in the Protecting People scenario occurs at the extreme poverty level of $1.90/day, poverty reduction in the Economic Response scenario is concentrated more among higher poverty levels, like the upper-middle income poverty threshold of $5.50/day. In short, the strict Economic Response is a boon for the middle class, but the worst-off groups benefit from targeted approaches, like that in Protecting People. \nOn the other hand, some interventions are complementary. Through taking an integrated approach, the region can harness synergies and reduce many tradeoffs that exist between the individual recovery scenarios. \nWith poverty reduction, it is possible to combine both the Economic Response and Protecting People strategies through an Integrated Recovery to grow the middle class without leaving the poorest behind. By mid-century, the Integrated Recovery scenario reduces the rate of extreme poverty by more than 70 percent, compared to the Current Path, and reduces poverty at the $5.50 level by nearly 40 percent.\n\n\n\nMoreover, combining approaches, when done well, can reduce tradeoffs by expanding the fiscal space. Interventions targeting economic growth alongside improvements in governance result in greater revenue, meaning more money that can be spent across other programs. The Integrated Recovery also leads to significant results in terms of government revenues. The Integrated Recovery scenario combines the rapid acceleration of growth from across scenarios with the improvements in government efficiency and effectiveness in Social Cohesion to generate additional revenue. By 2030, the scenario results in an additional $21 billion in annual government revenue across the region, a figure which grows to $185 billion by 2050. These revenues can have tremendous power if they are turned around and invested in the populations and future of Central Asian populations.\n\nScenarios\nHealth First\nThe Health First scenario is meant to be not only a scenario focused on addressing the immediate health crisis but on strengthening health systems and outcomes more broadly. The scenario assumptions or interventions include an increase in health spending as well as lowering the burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases by targeting the two sub-categories that make up the greatest burdens within those categories. \nThrough 2030 the Health First scenario results in a cumulative 4.1 million fewer disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which grows to 20 by 2050. Through lowering the health burdens of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, it prevents the deaths of 2,700 per year on average through mid-century. And it extends the life expectancy of the region on average by more than half a year. Moreover, a focus on long-term improvement of the health system will make the region significantly more resilient to future health crises and pandemics.\nHowever, a singular focus only on the health systems has tradeoffs. The increase in health spending crowds out investments in other areas, like education, R&amp;D, and infrastructure. The Health First scenario alone does not result in improvements in GDP and in fact by mid-century leads to a very slightly lower GDP per capita as a result of shifting investments and slight population growth. The benefits of improving the health system are clear, along with the importance of other policy focuses.\n\nProtecting People\nProtecting People is a scenario that comprises all of the non-health-system-related interventions meant to protect people‚Äôs livelihoods and futures. This includes measures to alleviate poverty and suffering in the short term through cash transfers as well as investments in education and expanding access to safe water.\nIn the immediate term, Protecting People has a significant effect alleviating poverty. Through 2030, compared with a No COVID scenario, it pulls more than 800,000 people in the region out of extreme poverty (1.90 level) and 1.2 million people out of the upper-middle-income poverty threshold ($5.50/day). By 2050, it results in 400,000 fewer people in extreme poverty ‚Äì a smaller gap than in 2030 due to expected progress along the Current Path and the waning effect of short-term policies alone ‚Äì and 2.3 million fewer people living on less than $5.50/day.\nAs a region, Central Asia has already achieved universal enrollment at the primary and lower secondary levels. But the Protecting People scenario improves outcomes in countries that are still behind to better the region as a whole. By 2050, the average education of the entire adult population is more than 10 percent greater than along the Current Path. Finally, improving water infrastructure results in 7,000 fewer children suffering from malnutrition by 2030.\nWhile these interventions in human development led to real improvements in the lives of people throughout the region, the Protecting People scenario alone still fails to address many important barriers to economic and social growth and does not address the key health system weaknesses revealed by the pandemic. It results in minimal changes to GDP, GDP per capita, as well as government revenue.\n\nEconomic Response\nAn underdeveloped private sector has been identified as an important limitation to Central Asia‚Äôs future growth. As discussed previously, the pandemic set back economic growth and, even with expected recovery, the region is not expected to catch up with its previous No COVID trajectory. The Economic Response scenario addresses this shortfall through measures aimed at traditional economic development. Interventions include increased exports and FDI, heightened investment in R&amp;D, expanded internet access, lowered unemployment, and improved quality of employment through lowering informality.\nThese interventions lead to real improvements in economic growth. The Economic Response scenario results in a cumulative $80 billion in regional GDP by 2030, leading to a cumulative $2.4 trillion in GDP gains by mid-century. In terms of GDP per capita, it surpasses the No COVID trajectory by 2044. \nThis growth results in reductions in poverty as well. By 2030, Economic Response pulls more than 500,000 people out of extreme poverty ($1.90/day) and 2.5 million people out of the upper-middle-income threshold ($5.50). While the Economic Response is powerful for those living at higher poverty thresholds, compared with the Protecting People scenario it is relatively less effective at pulling people out of extreme poverty, leaving hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable behind. A purely traditional focus on economic development results in real economic growth and fully makes up for the damage done by the pandemic. Absent further interventions, the benefits of that growth, in terms of poverty as well as human development, are not equally shared.\n\nSocial Cohesion\nGood governance is crucial throughout all aspects of development. The Social Cohesion scenario is aimed at improving governance through improving transparency, government capacity, and effectiveness. All Central Asian countries rank in the bottom half of countries globally for transparency (measured using Transparency International‚Äôs Corruptions Perception Index). Four of the five countries rank in the bottom half for government effectiveness (using World Bank‚Äôs World Governance Indicators), with Kazakhstan ranking 81 out of 186 countries. \nThe Social Cohesion scenario shows how powerful improvements in governance are for the region in the long run. By 2030, the Social Cohesion scenario results in a cumulative $50 billion in GDP gains. By mid-century, the Social Cohesion scenario is nearly as powerful as the pure Economic Response in generating growth, with a cumulative $2.1 trillion in GDP gains. \nOverall, the Social Cohesion scenario leads to some improvements by 2030, but really accelerates growth and poverty alleviation through mid-century. Good governance can be thought of as a key accelerator to support other policies. But these results show that a Social Cohesion and governance focus is incredibly powerful on its own ‚Äì resulting in nearly as much economic gain as an Economic Response and lifting nearly as many people out of extreme poverty as a strategy focused on Protecting People.\n\nIntegrated Recovery\nWhile the above scenarios all attempt to address a concentrated set of issues, they are not meant to be mutually exclusive. Just as the SDGs are ‚Äúintegrated and indivisible‚Äù, the pursuit of sustainable development requires a comprehensive effort that addresses multiple issue areas simultaneously. This is of course a challenging task. To better understand the challenges and benefits, we create an Integrated Recovery scenario, which comprises all of the interventions from the Health First, Protecting People, Economic Response, and Social Cohesion scenarios. \nThe Integrated Recovery leads to significantly accelerated growth. See Figure 2. While even the most rapid individual recovery scenarios only surpass the No COVID scenario by the 2043, the Integrated Recovery scenario surpasses it a full decade early, in 2033. By mid-century, it results in a cumulative total of $4.5 trillion in gains above the Current Path.\n\n\n\nThe effect of this accelerated growth in production is felt throughout the economy, lifting nearly 1.3 million people out of extreme poverty ($1.90/day) through 2030. Other outcomes also benefit from an integrated approach. By 2050 life expectancy grows by more than 1.3 years relative to the Current Path. This improvement is more than twice that seen in the Health First scenario alone, due to additional overall improvements in welfare and service provision.\n\nReview of country policies for Building scenarios\nWithin this research it was also examined how country governments were responding in real time to the pandemic. Through a review of databases and reports on policy responses to COVID-19 (ADB &amp; UNDP, 2020; EBRD, 2020; ESCAP, 2020; IMF, 2021; KPMG, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; Kurpayanidi et al., 2020; Kuznetsova et al., 2020; OECD, 2022), a database of over 100 broad policy responses from Central Asian governments was compiled. This database included health response measures, like increased investments in healthcare, virus suppression and mitigation measures, like school closures and travel restrictions, and economic responses, including unemployment benefits, support for small businesses, and tax deferrals.\nCreation of the COVID-19 recovery scenarios was based on reviewing the policy response database and combined interventions from the socio-economic response plans put together by Central Asian country teams for a core scenario framework. The core scenario framework was generally maintained, but the key interventions applicable to the Macroeconomic Response and Multilateral Communication stream ‚Äì increases in international trade and investment ‚Äì were incorporated into the Economic Response scenario. Because country challenges and starting points do differ significantly, at times the parameterization of interventions was adjusted to maintain appropriateness of the magnitude of interventions. \nInterventions were further refined through a series of webinars and consultative workshop sessions held remotely with UN teams from Central Asian country offices (Kazakhstan, Kyrzgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) as well as national partners from universities and think tanks.\nThe interventions from the recovery scenarios are listed in Table below\n\nList of interventions by scenario\n\n  Health First\n    \n      Increased government spending on health\n      Reduced burdens of non-communicable diseases\n      Reduced burdens of communicable diseases\n    \n  \n  Protecting People\n    \n      Increased household welfare transfers\n      Increased enrollment in primary education\n      Increased enrollment in lower-secondary education\n      Increased enrollment in upper-secondary education\n      Expanded access to safe water\n    \n  \n  Economic Response\n    \n      Increased government investment in research and development\n      Expansion of fixed broadband internet access\n      Reduction in informal employment\n      Reduced unemployment\n      Increased exports\n      Increased foreign direct investment.\n    \n  \n  Social Cohesion\n    \n      Improved government effectiveness\n      Increased transparency (reduced corruption)\n    \n  \n  Integrated Recovery\n    \n      Individual interventions from the Health First, Protecting People, Economic Response, and Social Cohesion scenarios are combined into one integrated scenario.\n    \n  \n\n","id":""},"/www/sdg-space/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/sdg-space/","title":"SDG Space ‚Äì Where Private sector meets Academia\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/www/sdg-stories/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/sdg-stories/","title":"Stories about SDGs in Central Asia\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/www/sdg-trends/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/sdg-trends/","title":"SDG Push Disgnostics for Central Asia\n","content":"SDG Push reimagines and recalibrates how we determine, interrogate and advance development interventions that put countries on more stable footing.

Development Goals (SDGs), given the interlinkages and cross-boundary issues among the 17 goals. We need to unpack these interlinkages and consider the potential synergies and trade-offs among different SDGs. Cross-boundary issues, such as climate change and inequality, can have impacts on multiple SDGs and require coordinated policy responses. This is a crucial element of sustanable development in Central Asia.\n\nTo address this complexity, countries are using various SDG complexity tools, such as systems mapping, scenario planning, and social network analysis. For example, Colombia has used systems mapping to identify the interconnections and leverage points among SDGs, while Thailand has used scenario planning to anticipate the potential impacts of external shocks on SDG progress. Other countries such as Ghana, Indonesia, and Mexico have also employed different complexity tools to better understand and address the interrelated challenges of the SDGs.\n\n\n  Systems mapping - used by Colombia to identify interconnections and leverage points among SDGs: https://www.colombia-sdg.org/\n  Scenario planning - used by Thailand to anticipate potential impacts of external shocks on SDG progress: https://siamintelligence.com/en/insights/thailand-2030/\n  Social network analysis - used by Ghana to identify key stakeholders and their influence on SDG progress: https://www.ghanaiansdgs.org/\n  Integrated planning and reporting - used by Indonesia to align national and subnational plans with SDGs: https://www.id.undp.org/content/indonesia/id/home/sustainable-development-goals.html\n  SDG dashboard - used by Mexico to monitor progress on SDGs and highlight data gaps: https://www.gob.mx/sesna/articulos/tablero-nacional-de-indicadores-ods-2030?idiom=es\n\n\nSDG systems in Central Asia\nSDG systems\n\n\nSDG Push Diagnostics for Interlinkages\nSynergies and Tradeoffs\nThe SDGs do not exist in silos. Understanding the interactions across social, economic and environmental elements of sustainable development is essential to move the needle on the SDGs. SDG Interlinkages show how actions directed towards one SDG can influence the others. Uncovering and understanding these interactions helps in achieving the 2030 Agenda - avoiding the unintended deterioration of the SDGs and their 169 associated targets.\nThe target-level interlinkages are based on the latest available methodology by the KnowSDGs Platform by European Commission. A first literature review (Miola et al., 2019) was updated and expanded in 2021-2022 by a team of researchers who retrieved and analysed all relevant scientific and grey literature* on SDG interlinkages, both in Scopus and Google Scholar.\n\nSDG Accelerators for Kazakhstan\nüî∑ 2.4: Sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agriculture. \nüî∑ 4.4: Skills for employment\nüî∑ 7.2.

Addressing cross-border issues in Central Asia is the key for achieving SDGs\n\nWater management\nCentral Asia is home to several major rivers, including the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which are shared by multiple countries. Disputes over water allocation, infrastructure development, and pollution are common. One solution is to promote regional cooperation through the establishment of joint institutions, such as the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), which is supported by the EU and UNDP. Other initiatives include the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúCAREC Integrated Water Resources Management Project‚Äù and the EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Water-Energy Nexus Dialogue Platform.‚Äù\n\nEnergy security\nCentral Asia is a major producer and exporter of oil, gas, and electricity, but many countries still face energy shortages and rely on imports. There is also a need to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Energy Security Dialogue‚Äù and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúRegional Dialogue on Energy Security in Central Asia‚Äù aim to promote cooperation on energy policy and investment.\n\nTrade development\nCentral Asia has enormous potential for trade, but many countries still face barriers to accessing international markets. Promoting trade and economic integration, as well as investing in infrastructure and human capital, can help unlock this potential. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúSupporting the Implementation of WTO TFA in Central Asia‚Äù project and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúIntegrated Framework for Trade-Related Assistance to Least Developed Countries‚Äù aim to promote trade facilitation and economic growth.\n\nBorder management\nCentral Asia has many porous borders, which pose security risks and can impede trade and travel. Promoting transparency and cooperation among border agencies, as well as investing in infrastructure and technology, can help address these challenges. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúBorder Management Programme for Central Asia‚Äù and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Border Security Programme‚Äù are working to support these efforts.\n\nEnvironmental degradation\nCentral Asia faces many environmental challenges, including desertification, deforestation, and air and water pollution. These issues often transcend national boundaries and require regional cooperation and policy coordination. The EU‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asia Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Climate Change‚Äù project and the UNDP‚Äôs ‚ÄúCentral Asian Desert Initiative‚Äù are working to promote sustainable land use and environmental management.\n\n\n","id":""},"/www/transport-corridors/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/transport-corridors/","title":"Transport Corridors in Central Asia\n","content":"\n\n\n","id":""},"/www/vnr/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/www/vnr/","title":"Voluntary national reviews\n","content":"Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) are a critical component of the SDGs monitoring process at the national level. VNRs are country-led assessments of progress towards achieving the SDGs and involve the submission of a report by each country to the United Nations. The report presents the country‚Äôs achievements, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing the SDGs, as well as its plans for future action. VNRs are voluntary, but their submission is highly encouraged and viewed as a way for countries to engage in dialogue and share experiences on SDGs implementation. The VNR process enables countries to learn from each other‚Äôs experiences and challenges, identify gaps in their policies and strategies, and improve their efforts towards achieving the SDGs. Moreover, VNRs facilitate transparency and accountability, as countries are expected to report on their progress towards the SDGs to their citizens and the international community. By engaging in the VNR process, countries can accelerate their progress towards the SDGs and contribute to the achievement of the global sustainable development agenda.\n\n Kazakhstan\nüåê Voluntary
