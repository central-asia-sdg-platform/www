üî∏ Countries of Central Asia face similar challenges in achievement of SDGs. There is a great scope of intra-regional cooperation and economic collaboration. Achievement of SDGs requires whole-of-society approach and active engagement of partners. There are a lot of opportunities for peer learning between countries. 

üî∏ The Intergovernmental Commission is a special format, a government platform, of international relations, which allows for bilateral cooperation between countries, for the interaction of the parties, covering all major areas of the economy. Example of activities of Intergovernmental Commissions of Kyrgyz Republic https://mineconom.gov.kg/ru/direct/12 (in Russian)

üî∏ Voluntary National Reviews played important role in monitoring and reporting on SDGs. All countries of Central Asia prepared and presented their first VNRs and have plans for next round: Kazakhstan 2019, forthcoming 2022; Kyrgyzstan 2020; Tajikistan 2017, forthcoming 2023; Turkmenistan 2019, forthcoming 2023; Uzbekistan 2020, forthcoming 2023.

**Open floor discussion**

### Session 2 Takeaways
üî∏ The SDGs have been given intensive attention in terms of ‚Äútop-down‚Äù approach‚Äîdeveloping national SDG targets, integrating an SDG perspective into policy reform agendas, and tracking progress towards SDGs at the national level. It needs to be complemented by a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù up approach that links nationally significant projects and programs with the SDGs

üî∏ Focus on the missing link between the SDGs and the development projects and programs and the scaling pathways are necessary to close the gap between ‚Äútop-down‚Äù support to SDGs and ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù implementation. There are working approaches for scaling up, which requires a change in mindset and systematic implementation.

üî∏ SDGs outcome indicators should be linked to development projects and programs KPIs to ensure coherence and meaningful interlinkages between interventions.

üî∏ Even with uncertain futures, scenario modelling allows us to explore trade-offs and synergies across different policy packages. The best way is to use existing regional scenarios for country modelling and regularly update them. This could be done by think tanks, Universities, or NGOs and provide a flexible tool for Governments for evidence-based and integrated policy-making for SDGs. Inter alia it will strengthen government credibility in the policy communication to different groups in society.

üî∏ Governments of Central Asia implemented various measures to soften impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main challenge is a huge demand for infrastructure projects, which need more efficient financing. Due to the large gap, the Governments are looking for different type of financing‚ÄîGovernment, Private, Public-Private Partnership. [Integrated National Financial Frameworks](https://inff.org/) are necessary. 

üî∏ MSMEs were particularly hard hit by COVID-19 crisis. Partnership played crucial role in maintaining MSMEs, reducing negative impacts and adopting to new business conditions. One example is Kazakhstan ‚ÄúAtamaken‚Äù, a network organization. Another example is Tajikistan Business Incubator, which coordinated support to MSMEs. 


## Session 3. Digitalization of public services as an accelerator for the Sustainable Development Goals
üî∑ **Session questions**: How can digitalization of public services be an accelerator for realizing the SDGs? The focus of this session ‚Äì stories about inclusive digitalization, making sure that no one is left behind. Countries will give practical examples of digitalization with a human face: E-fiscalization in Kyrgyzstan, Electronic courts in Uzbekistan, Strengthening public services for entrepreneurs and investors in Tajikistan.

### Session 3 Takeaways
üî∏ Digitalization could offer integration of digital services between countries of Central Asia, for both commercial and public services. It requires harmonization of requirements between countries of Central Asia, and strengthening of personal data protection. 

üî∏ Current understanding of innovations moved from Tech-centred view towards Multidisciplinary Agency view of innovation. We need to understand innovation in a broader sense. Multiple drivers of innovation are going well beyond more tech and data, and include institutional context, leadership and decision making, networks and collaboration, organizational structure, results and impact. They differ for different cities, and play different roles throughout the innovation cycle. Collaboration and trust building are key for innovations.

üî∏ To achieve [SDG1]({{ site.baseurl }}/1/) Government of Kazakhstan digitalized all social payments via e-gov system and banks. Currently working with Ministry of Labor and Social Protection to do early detection of social vulnerabilities. Forthcoming Digital Family Social Card should include 64 social protection indicators to identify where people need support. 

üî∏ GIS monitoring systems, based on satellite Earth scanning, are of great value for agriculture, water and waste management. Kazakhstan suggest collaboration in the areas of agriculture, water, cross-border rives to share resources necessary for setting up a system and conduct joint monitoring.

üî∏ Kyrgyzstan suggests to work on making digital services accessible and aligned across borders‚Äî taking into account that region of Central Asia is very interconnected. This will require regional coordination and regulation of data, including personal data protection, joint efforts on data and cyber security, to guarantee safe data exchange.

üî∏ Having digitally educated people across all professions is a key for implementation of digital solutions, rather than technological solutions per se. This requires re- and up-skilling of workforce in all sectors. 


## Special session. Mayors‚Äô roundtable on localization of the Sustainable Development Goals 
üî∑ **Session questions**: How can we act locally focused on global and regional goals? The session will discuss measures and approaches on the drawing board for the mix of large and smaller cities‚Äô development in Central Asian and for their transition to sustainable development by localizing SDGs. Also, on the agenda ‚Äì increasing cooperation and partnerships between capitals and cities and joining forces to develop sound measures for regions to attain the SDGs. The session will benefit from experiences of other location around the globe. The mayors invited to present at this round table come from the big and small cities that are experienced with SDG localization as well as participate in UNDP‚Äôs City Experiment Fund. These small and big cities share common issues pertaining their development and realization of SDGs.

### Special session Takeaways
üî∏ Development happens locally. Public services that matter‚Äîclean water, electricity, schools, hospitals‚Äîare by units close to where people live. Empowerment of local administration combined with increased accountability is a way forward. Sound urban planning and approaches via collaboration with stakeholders.

üî∏ The process of development of [Istanbul Vision 2050](https://vizyon2050.istanbul/en) showed the power of mutual learning through the international cooperation.

### Session 4 Takeaways
üî∏ Young people don‚Äôt have a voice in climate change decision making, while the youth also will bear higher longer-term economic and social costs. Engagement of you should be limited to education (using future proof curriculum), but also provide active engagement, immersion activities and field placements. 

üî∏ We need to avoid objectifying youth but talking and listening to youth. We want to introduce flexible youth strategy, which encourage bottom-up approach by observing existing initiatives and providing opportunities for replication and scaling up. 

üî∏ Education is an important factor for political and economic empowerment of women. Family support and positive examples play crucial roles in promotion of girl education.
